# We set the python interpreter to the ansible runtime venv if
# the delegation is to localhost so that we get access to the
# appropriate python libraries in that venv. If the delegation
# is to another host, we assume that it is accessible by the
# system python instead.

# NOTE (noonedeadpunk) We can't move domain creation inside service_setup.yml
# since for role assignment we need to provide ID of created domain instead of
# domain name (which we have). This might be dropped right after backport of
# https://github.com/ansible/ansible/commit/737da1853ef2239e27a2fe380c3e83ba5b34de5b
